                <h2>The Text Book - Al-’Aqida al-Tahawiyya</h2>
                <p>
                The creed of Imam al-Tahawi (D. 321AH), Bayan al-Sunnah wa al-Jama’ah, commonly known as the al-’Aqida al-Tahawiyya is the masterpiece on the ‘Aqida of Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jama’ah penned by the renowned 3rd Century Theologian, Muhaddith and Jurist, Imam Abu Ja’far Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Azdi al-Tahawi al-Hanafi. It is the widely accepted ‘Aqida work dealing with the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama’ah (Sunni Islam) stemming back over a period well exceeding a millennium. Tahawi’s “Doctrine” (al-’Aqida), though small in size, is a basic text for all times, listing what a Muslim must know, believe and inwardly comprehend. There is consensus among the Companions, the Successors and all the leading Islamic authorities such as the four Imams and their authoritative followers on the doctrines enumerated in this work, which are entirely derived from the undisputed primary sources of Religion, the Holy Qur’an and the confirmed Ahadith. Being a text on Islamic doctrine, this work sums up the arguments set forth in those two sources to define sound belief, and likewise, the arguments advanced in refuting the views of sects that have deviated from the Sunnah.

Currently, he is working on writing a bulky work on the matter of where the hands should be placed in Salah with an analysis of practically all known narrations on this specific matter. This work will by Allah’s decree also show some rare narrations that have not been quoted by most of the Muhaddithin of the past and have been discovered by means of painstakingly collecting rare Arabic manuscripts from some Muslim lands. In this regard, he is also a collector of Arabic manuscripts and to date holds more than 5000 from all over the world.<p>
<p>Many of his articles and books are due to be published for free distribution on a new website known as darultahqiq.com.</p>
